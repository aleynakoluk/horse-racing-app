<h1>Horse Racing Game</h1>
<p>This project is a game project in which users can play horse racing. Vue.js is built using modern web technologies such as Vue CLI and Vuex. The main feature of the project is that it is a racing program covering 6 different races with 10 horses randomly selected from a list containing 20 different colored horses. Each horse's condition, which varies between 1 and 100, affects its performance at different race distances and provides a realistic racing experience.
</p>
<p>When the <b>GENERATE PROGRAM</b> button is pressed, 10 horses are randomly selected from 20 horses. The selected horses appear in the Program table. These horses are placed on the race track with their position numbers.</p>

<p>The <b>START/PAUSE</b> button has several functions. To start or stop the race. If the race has not started, it starts the race. If this button is pressed during the race, the race will be stopped. If the button is pressed after the race is stopped, the race continues from where it left off.</p>
